# hoymiles-wifi

This Python library facilitates communication with Hoymiles DTUs and the HMS-XXXXW-2T HMS microinverters, utilizing protobuf messages.

For the Home Assistant integration have a look here:
https://github.com/suaveolent/ha-hoymiles-wifi

> [!NOTE]
> Disclaimer: This library is not affiliated with Hoymiles. It is an independent project developed to provide tools for interacting with Hoymiles DTUs and Hoymiles HMS-XXXXW series micro-inverters featuring integrated WiFi DTU. Any trademarks or product names mentioned are the property of their respective owners.

## Supported Devices

The library was successfully tested with:

- Hoymiles HMS-400W-1T
- Hoymiles HMS-800W-2T
- Hoymiles HMS-2000DW-4T
- Hoymiles DTU-WLite
- Hoymiles DTU-Pro (S)
- Solenso  H-1000 (not tested for command, only to get data)
- Solenso  DTU_SLS (not tested for command, only to get data)

## Installation

```
$ pip install hoymiles-wifi
```

## Usage

You can integrate the library into your own project, or simply use it in the command line.

### Command line:

```
hoymiles-wifi [-h] --host HOST [--local_addr IP_OF_INTERFACE_TO_USE] [--as-json] <command> [--disable-interactive]

commands:
    get-real-data-new,
    get-real-data,
    get-config,
    network-info,
    app-information-data,
    app-get-hist-power,
    set-power-limit,
    set-wifi,
    firmware-update,
    restart-dtu,
    turn-on-inverter,
    turn-off-inverter,
    get-information-data,
    get-version-info,
    heartbeat,
    identify-dtu,
    identify-inverters,
    identify-meters,
    get-alarm-list,
    enable-performance-data-mode,

The `--as-json` option is optional and allows formatting the output as JSON.
The `--disable-interactive` option is optional allows to disable interactive modes (e.g. for setting the power limit).
For the `set-power-limit` command, you can also use the `--power-limit` parameter to specify the desired power limit. This requires the `--disable-interactive` option to be enabled.
```

### Python code

```python
from hoymiles_wifi.dtu import DTU
...
dtu = DTU(<ip_address>)
response = await dtu.<command>

if response:
    print(f"DTU Response: {response}")
else:
    print("Unable to get response!")
```

## Note

Please be aware:

> [!NOTE]
> No DTU Implementation: This library retrieves information directly from the (internal) DTU of Hoymiles Wifi inverters.

## Caution

Use this library responsibly and be aware of potential risks. There are no guarantees provided, and any misuse or incorrect implementation may result in undesirable outcomes. Ensure that your inverter is not compromised during communication.

## Known Limitations

### Update Frequency:

> [!NOTE]
> The library may encounter limitations in fetching updates, restricting updates to approximately twice per minute.
> This issue can be identified when the data returned matches the response from the previous request.
> If you encounter this, you have three options:
>
> 1. Set the update interval to 35 seconds or longer between requests.
> 2. Use `async_enable_performance_data_mode()`
> 3. Open the S-Miles Installer App, connect to the DTU, and access the Toolkit (which sends the same data as option 2).
>
> Options 2 and 3 need to be repeated whenever the DTU restarts.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Setting the update interval below approximately 32 seconds may disable Hoymiles cloud functionality. To ensure proper communication with Hoymiles servers, keep the update interval at or above this threshold.

> [!CAUTION]
> Setting the update interval to 1â€“2 seconds could also cause disruptions in the App's connection.

### Compatibility:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> While developed for the HMS-800W-2T inverter, compatibility with other inverters from the series is untested at the time of writing. Exercise caution and conduct thorough testing if using with different inverter models.
